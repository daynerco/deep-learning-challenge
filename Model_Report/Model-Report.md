**Neural-Network-Model**

*Overview of the analysis*
Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, would like a tool that can help the foundation select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. A binary classifier was created as part of a neural network to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by AlphabetSoup.


*Results*

    *Data Preprocessing*

       Metrics that were deemed unnecessary, like 'EIN' and 'NAME' were removed from the data and the remaining metrics were considered in the model. As far as features the variables 'CLASSIFICATION' and 'APPLICATION_TYPE' were used in the model. The target variable was 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'. 


    *Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model*

        How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
        Were you able to achieve the target model performance? I was able to acheive an accuracy of 77% when i added a third layer and changed the epoch to 200
        What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?


*Summary* 

It is optimal to utilize several considers to achieve optimum results. This includes multiple layers, epoch levels,
